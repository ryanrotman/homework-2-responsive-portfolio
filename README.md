# Homework 2: Responsive Portfolio

# Description

This repository holds the second homework assignment for [The Coding Boot Camp](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/) through the University of Texas at Austin's Center for Professional Education.

This assignment is a project using responsive design. For this project we were tasked with creating a portfolio webpage using HTML and Bootstrap that included three pages:

* Home/About Me
* Portfolio
* Contact

This project really tested and honed the concept of using Bootstrap's grid system. Using containers, rows, columns, and even sub-rows and sub-columns along with the breakpoints for `xs` and `sm` screensizes allows for great responsiveness to the layout and design of the pages. I'm a creative and this project really spoke to that side of me. 

## Notes

In completing this project, here are some samples of the work I did.

* Added a consistent navbar with links across all three pages while adjusting the brand as well as the active selection of the current page.

    <!-- > insert Portfolio navbar screenshot -->
    <!-- > insert Contact navbar screenshot -->

* Semantic html elements

* Used sub-rows and sub-columns as well as the breakpoints to set up my social media buttons with links
    <!-- > insert xs social media screenshot -->
    <!-- > insert sm social media screenshot -->

* It was also a requirement to use a HTML validation service to check the HTML

    <!-- > insert Contact validation screenshot -->
